# whatsappStickerMaker

Similar to sticker maker on android, this is an C# application that allows users to create whatsapp sticker packs(.wastickers).

The program allows users to select images from their computer, and converts it to the correct pixel size for a sticker(512x512) or a pack icon.

It can create the sticker pack and convert the files to the correct format. The final part that needs to be fixed is that the pack needs to be recognized by sticker maker on android. And for a "select multiple photos" toggle button to be created
